% The blank page environment allows you to insert
% pages into your thesis for specific things

\begin{blankpage}
    \chapterTitle{A blank page}
    This is an optional page environment you could use for things like:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Your own custom preamble chapters (use \texttt{\textbackslash chapterTitle} for titles!)
		\item \emph{``This work is dedicated to Dad and Mom''}
		\item A copyright notice
		\item Additional notes
		\item Quotes
		\item List of publications
		\item An actual blank page
		\item Nomenclature / glossaries, etc.
	\end{itemize}
	It is not recommended to use this in your undergraduate thesis for submission. It has been left in here to make you aware of its existence. This is largely because it does not follow the guidelines set out for undergraduate theses, but you could include this environment for your own personal printed copy. Consult with your supervisor to see if you can use it. 
	
	In addition, you can pass an optional parameter to this environment with the value \texttt{c} to centre this text vertically on the page (use the \texttt{center} environment to align horizontally).
