% What will be displayed in the header: the assessment item
\thesisHeaderContents{Master Thesis}

% Uncommenting the \thesisTurnOffHF line below will remove your name + id from the footer
% as well as removing the header contents. It is NOT recommended to do this
% as the presentation policy for assessed work in the SoCS requires
% these both of these. However, you may want to uncomment this for other
% reasons: i.e. when printing a personal copy which is NOT going to be
% submitted.

% body in the table of contents? e.g. Abstract, List of Tables,
% List of Figures, etc.
% 
% This is what the command below does.
% 
% Just uncomment it if you this is what you desire:
% -----------------
% \enableManualTOCEntries

% But what if you want to remove "List of Figures", "List of Tables",
% and "Table of Contents" from the table of contents, but leave
% your original sections? That's ok, just uncomment the line below:
% ------------------
% \disableTableTOCEntries
