% reasons: i.e. when printing a personal copy which is NOT going to be
% submitted.

% But what if you want to remove "List of Figures", "List of Tables",
% and "Table of Contents" from the table of contents, but leave
% your original sections? That's ok, just uncomment the line below:
% ------------------
% \disableTableTOCEntries
