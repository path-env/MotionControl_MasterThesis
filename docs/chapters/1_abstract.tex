    The aim of this project is to research, implement and provide comparative analysis of brain signal measured with OpenBCI EEG headgear and use it to control a simulated car in CARLA, an open-source platform for autonomous driving simulation. Both conventional signal processing and Deep Learning techniques are studied and implemented. The following chapters provide theories and reasons behind choosing the specific methods to achieve the task. The algorithm is run in real-time as a ROS node implemented in python. Several tools and libraries such as ROS, LSL, MNE, Kymatio, PyTorch and similar libraries are used.
